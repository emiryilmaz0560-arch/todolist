# Development Experience with Bolt.new

## Tool Selection
I chose Bolt.new because it provides an agentic, browser-based development experience and allows building full applications through natural language prompts. Its instant preview feature made it ideal for this Todo List project.

## Development Process
The development process consisted of writing a single prompt describing the required features. Bolt.new generated the full application structure, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The application worked correctly after the first generation without requiring a second iteration.

## Challenges and Solutions
One challenge was understanding the generated code structure. While the AI produced functional code, reviewing the files was necessary to understand how features such as localStorage were implemented. Minimal manual adjustments were required.

## Reflection
This project demonstrated how vibe coding tools can accelerate development and simplify the creation of functional applications. The experience changed my perspective on software development, shifting focus from syntax to intent. I would consider using such tools for future prototyping and learning-oriented projects.
